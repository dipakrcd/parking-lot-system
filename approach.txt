parking Lot System(working of project)
- The technology used to develop the application is Ruby on Rails Framework. Because of Ruby on Rails is easy to learn and used 
for fast development

steps followed :- 
- In parking Lot System, the Parking Slots is created using seed file with creating x_co-ordinates, y_co-ordinates ,and distance 
 from the entry points saved in database. 

 - The entry points taken as x_co-ordinate as 0 and y_co-ordinate as 0. and finding the all distances from the entry points. And save
 that distance in database by running seed file . 

 - The distances from the entry points are calculted using pythagoras theoram and all distances from the entry points are calculated
  digologically

 - We have to set Total Number of slots and number of slots available per row in ParkingSlot model. So that the design of parking 
 slots is creted on views.

 - To park a car in paking slot , we have to first register car into the system. After car is registered in the system, we can park that 
 car and then new ticket for that car is generated and assigned nearest slot to that car. 

 - relations for Parking Lot System is - 1 car has_many tickets 
                                         1 tickets has_one paking_slot
